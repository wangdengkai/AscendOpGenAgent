#!/usr/bin/env bash
# loop-stop.sh — Stop hook for Z-Search loop.
#
# Activated by .claude/settings.json. Triggered when the agent attempts to
# stop. Receives Claude Code's hook JSON on stdin (we mostly don't need it).
#
# Behavior:
#   1. Locate state.json by walking up from cwd.
#   2. If state.json absent or stage is terminal (done/aborted) → exit 0 (allow stop).
#   3. Otherwise run rule checks (R2-R5) and block (exit 2) if violations found.
#
# Rules (see .claude/skills/evolution-world-model/references/state_schema.md):
#   R2.1 stage=round_generate but partials are running/pending
#   R2.x stage=round_refine/round_react/round_checkpoint but evaluation_results.json missing
#   R3   drift_status=replan_required and stage in {round_select, round_generate}
#   R4   must_run_before_next_round non-empty and stage=round_select
#   R5   state.evo_dir disagrees with hook-detected evo_dir
#   R14  ledger entries (lineage.jsonl) have stale null diagnosis vs world_model.json
#   R15  open_exploration node has non-empty strategy_combination (must stay [])
#   R16  open_exploration node has a stub description (<100 chars) after dispatch
#
# Escape hatch: LOOP_HOOK_DISABLE=1 downgrades to warn-only.
